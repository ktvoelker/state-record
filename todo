Try making (//) be a method of a class. It could then package up the
combination behind the functional interface of a MonadField, which would
mean that the Field classes would only have to have instances for a finite
number of field forms.

Implement the recommendations in the file "table".

Support records with an empty prefix correctly by not capitalizing the names.

Support records which have two variants with a common field by only generating
a single field descriptor.

Support underscore-based naming as well as camel case. Provide wrappers around
a single underlying function which takes all the relevant parameters.

Write tests.
