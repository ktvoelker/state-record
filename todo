Implement the recommendations in the file "table".

Support records with an empty prefix correctly by not capitalizing the names.

Support records which have two variants with a common field by only generating
a single field descriptor.

Support underscore-based naming as well as camel case. Provide wrappers around
a single underlying function which takes all the relevant parameters.

Write tests.
