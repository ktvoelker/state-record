Add export list to the new main module.

Add Reader/ReaderT support to the new main module (askf and proj).

  Can any FieldPaths with mixtures of States and Readers be supported?

Support records with an empty prefix correctly by not capitalizing the names.

Support records which have two variants with a common field by only generating
a single field descriptor.

Support underscore-based naming as well as camel case. Provide wrappers around
a single underlying function which takes all the relevant parameters.

Write tests.
