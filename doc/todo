Improve the Containers module
* Fields are just lenses; the functions in this module shouldn't directly access
  anything, they should just create lenses
* One type of lens should access a value in a map given a particular key, with a
  default value to insert and access if the value is not found
  * This is just a specialization of an accessor that provides a Maybe value

Support records which have two variants with a common field by only generating
a single field descriptor.

Support underscore-based naming as well as camel case. Provide wrappers around
a single underlying function which takes all the relevant parameters.

Write tests.
