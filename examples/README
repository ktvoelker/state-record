README: usage examples for Data.Record.StateFields
==================================================

These examples do not cover everything that you can do with this module.

More examples might be added if you request them.

The structure is that the 'old' directory shows how you would do a certain
thing without Data.Record.StateFields, while the corresponding file in the 'new'
directory shows how to do the same thing with Data.Record.StateFields.
